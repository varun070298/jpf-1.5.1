JPF Build Instructions

STEP 0. Prerequisites.
To build JPF from source code you'll need the following software to be installed
on your computer:
- Java SDK (JDK) version 1.3 or newer;
- Apache Ant version 1.5 or newer.
All other required libraries are included into JPF source code distribution
package.

STEP 1. Get JPF source code.
Download JPF source code archive from the project web site
  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110394
and unpack it to any directory.

STEP 2. Adjust build parameters (optional step).
JPF top-level directory contains "build.properties" and "build.xml" files. By
default, you do not need to change any of the settings in these files, but you
do need to run Ant from this location so it knows where to find them. If you
wish to change build parameters, edit build.properties file instead of
"build.xml".

STEP 2. Run Ant.
Assuming you have Ant in your PATH and have set ANT_HOME to the location of your
Ant installation, typing "ant" at the shell prompt should run Ant. Ant will by
default look for the "build.xml" file in your current directory, and display
available JPF build targets with short descriptions. To get binary distribution
package of JPF type:
  ant dist
To get JPF JAR files only type:
  ant jar
